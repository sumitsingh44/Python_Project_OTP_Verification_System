## üîçProject Overview:
This project involves the development of an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system in Python. The primary goal is to generate a 6-digit OTP, send it to the user's email, and validate the OTP entered by the user. This system can be used for secure user verification in various applications.

## üîßTools Used:

- ![Random](https://img.shields.io/badge/Random-OTP%20Generation-red)

## üõ†Ô∏èSteps Undertaken:

1. **OTP Generation** - Created a Python function to generate a random 6-digit OTP.

2. **Sending OTP** - Implemented a function using smtplib to send the OTP to the user's email address.

3. **User Input** - Developed a function to prompt the user to enter the OTP received.

4. **OTP Verification** - Implemented a function to compare the entered OTP with the generated OTP and validate it.

5. **User Interaction** - Ensured proper error handling and user-friendly messages. Allowed users to retry OTP entry if the input was incorrect.

## :books:Learnings:

1. **Python Programming** - Enhanced Python programming skills through the implementation of the OTP system.

2. **Email Handling** - Gained experience in using smtplib for sending emails programmatically.

3. **User Interaction** - Improved understanding of user interaction and error handling in Python applications.

4. **Code Quality** - Learned best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code.

5. **Security Considerations** - Developed awareness of security considerations in handling sensitive information, such as OTPs and email addresses.

## :checkered_flag:Conclusion:

This project provided practical experience in developing a secure OTP verification system using Python. Through generating, sending, and validating OTPs, the project demonstrated important skills in Python programming, email handling, and user interaction. The skills acquired in this project are crucial for implementing secure user verification in real-world applications.
